## 🏗️ Post-Functionality Development

Once core functionality is complete, use the following plans for quality assurance, planning, and design implementation.

### **Option 1: Planning and Prioritization**

1.  **Evaluate using UX Rubric:** Review the project against the rubric linked below.
      - **Rubric Video:** [https://youtu.be/5Lu7k2SShNw?t=748](https://youtu.be/5Lu7k2SShNw?t=748)

2.  **Create a Plan:** Develop a plan using the UX rubric guidelines.
3.  **Cherry-Pick:** Select and prioritize the **most important items** from the plan to build.

### **Option 2: Design Override (Cosmetic Changes)**

Alternatively, use this prompt to enforce a specific design aesthetic:

> 'Analyze my existing project, then override all CSS and visual styling to match the uploaded **design.md** specifications while preserving all functionality and HTML structure'

## 🧹 Code Cleanup and Security Audits

**Execute the following steps in the specified order, performing the entire cleanup process at least two times.**

### **1. Security & Data Audit**

  - **Browser Data Storage:** Check for any data being stored in the browser (e.g., Local Storage, Session Storage). **Confirm deletion with me first.**
  - **Data Exposure:** Check for any sensitive data being exposed in the browser (e.g., API keys, secrets).

### **2. Code Quality & Optimization**

1.  **Run Knip:** Execute the following command to find unused files, dependencies, and exports but ask LLM to investigate further if these are real issues or not
    ```bash
    npm run knip
    ```
2.  **Check for Code Duplication.**
3.  **Check for Code Refactoring:** Identify and implement improvements for code structure, readability, and maintainability.
